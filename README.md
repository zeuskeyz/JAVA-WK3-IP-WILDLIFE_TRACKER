# Superhero Squad Recruitment App

The Wildlife Tracker App is a Java Spark SQL-based application that allows users to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes for various causes. Users can create and manage heroes, squads, and assign heroes to squads. The app also includes functionality to calculate scores for specific skill areas and has the potential for a turn-based battle system.

## Features

The Superhero Squad Recruitment App provides the following features:

- Create and manage heroes: Users can create heroes with a name, age, special power, and weakness. Heroes can be freely assigned or chosen from a pre-determined set of special powers and weaknesses.
- Create and manage squads: Users can create squads with a maximum size, name, and cause they are dedicated to fighting. Examples of causes include sexism, computer illiteracy, not covering your mouth when you sneeze, hogging bus seats with your backpack, passive-aggressive post-it notes, etc.
- Assign heroes to squads: Users can assign heroes to squads, ensuring that each hero can participate in only one squad at a time.
- Skill area scoring: The app allows calculating scores for specific skill areas such as defense, distance attacks, etc. Users can assess the overall strength and balance of their squads based on these scores.
- Turn-based battle system (optional): The app has the potential for integrating a turn-based battle system, where squads can engage in battles and showcase their abilities. Users can further extend the app to implement this feature.
